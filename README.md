# SPE_model
model of Subject Pronoun Expression in child Spanish

Optimal model assumes children in mono-dialectal and contact situations accurately learn and deploy priors and likelihoods to determine the posterior probability of overt or null SPE given the pronoun's reference P(pronoun|reference).


# How to display the notebooks 

R notebooks (.Rmd files) are not displayed well in Github, so you will need to download the .Rmd file and knit it to HTML in R in order to see the notebook as it is meant to be seen.:

1. Make sure that you install the `knitr` package. If you are using RStudio, `knitr` should add this button to the top of the coding pane.

2. Open the .Rmd file in RStudio. Click Knit > Knit to HTML 

3. Knitr will exectue all the code in the the .Rmd notebook and then convert the output into a pretty-looking HTML.
